    <h4>Our ERP system is an all-in-one enterprise management platform that integrates Finance, HRMS, Sales, Production, and Procurement into a single unified solution. It is designed to help businesses streamline operations, improve collaboration, and make smarter data-driven decisions
        With modular architecture and modern UI/UX, the ERP ensures flexibility—allowing companies to scale as they grow. Each department can work seamlessly while sharing accurate, real-time information, reducing redundancies and improving efficiency.</h4><br>

        Security,
        IT Admin
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Problem :</h3><br>
